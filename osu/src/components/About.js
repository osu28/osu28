        <h2>About Me </h2>
        <p>I am a junior at Purdue University studying Computer Science and Data Science. I have used my time in college so far to explore a wide array of fields including full stack web development, devops, and machine learning.</p>
        <p>Outside of class, I spend my time traveling, lifting weights, hooping with friends, teaching math & programming, and gaming the night away :)</p>
        <p>I am based in the D.C. Metropolitan Area, where I am excited to be a part of a growing tech hub. I am interested in internship opportunities related to software engineering for the summer of 2023, where I can put my problem solving skills to use!</p>
        <p>To see some of my experience, hereâ€™s my resume.</p>
